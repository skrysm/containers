      # NOTE: We use Docker Hub rather than GitHub's container registry because the docker/build-push-action action
      #   apparently produces container images that GitHub's container registry doesn't fully support (it will result
      #   in an unknown/unknown architecture). The only workaround is to disable provenance (see
      #   https://github.com/docker/build-push-action/issues/820#issuecomment-1482113833) but provenance improves
      #   the "trustworthiness" of the image. So, I'd rather leave it on.
